# HR Data Service
This section provides information and guidelines for the HR Data Service.  The HR Data Service will serve as the Data Access Layer (DAL) for all HR .NET applications.  The approach provides a layer of abstraction to access disparate data sources including, but not limited to Oracle and SQL Server Databases, using a standardized approach by calling the HR Data Service APIs.

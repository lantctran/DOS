# HR Data Service
This section provides information regarding the HR Data Service.  The HR Data Service serves as the Data Layer for all .NET applications.  The approach provides a layer of abstraction to access disparate data sources including, but not limited to Oracle and SQL Server Databases.  The HR Data Service allows different .NET applications to retrieve the same way using custom developed methods, independent of what the database is (i.e. Oracle, SQL Server, PostgresSQL).

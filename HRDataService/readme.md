# HR Data Service
This section provides information and guidelines for the HR Data Service.  The HR Data Service serves as the Data Access Layer (DAL) for all HR .NET applications.  The approach provides a layer of abstraction to access disparate data sources including, but not limited to Oracle and SQL Server Databases, using a standardized approach accross applications by calling the HR Data Service APIs.  

The benefits of n-tier architecture is well documented to provide for better maintainability, reusability, and scalability.  "It does this by enabling easier adoption of new technologies that can be applied to a single tier without the requirement to redesign the whole solution. In addition, n-tier applications typically store sensitive information in the middle-tier, which maintains isolation from the presentation tier."

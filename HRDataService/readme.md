# HR Data Service
This section provides information and guidelines for the HR Data Service.  The HR Data Service serves as the Data Access Layer (DAL) for all HR .NET applications.  The approach provides a layer of abstraction to access disparate data sources including, but not limited to Oracle and SQL Server Databases, using a standardized approach accross applications by calling the HR Data Service APIs.  

The benefits of having multiple layers is well documented to provide for better maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

# HR Data Service
This section provides information and guidelines for the HR Data Service.  The HR Data Service serves as the Data Access Layer (DAL) for all HR .NET applications.  The approach provides a layer of abstraction to access disparate data sources including, but not limited to Oracle and SQL Server Databases, using a standardized approach accross applications by calling the HR Data Service APIs.  

The benefits of n-tier architecture is well documented to provide for better maintainability, reusability, and scalability.  This is achieved by enabling easier adoption of new technologies and/or changes that can be applied to a single tier without the requirement to redesign the whole solution. In addition, n-tier applications can store domain logic and sensitive information in the middle-tier (business logic layer), which maintains isolation from the presentation layer.

The HR Data Service should only be used by the Business Logic Layer.  It should never be accessed directly from the Presentation Layer (i.e. Web Form, MVC, Web API, and/or Web Service applications).  Please refer to the image below for conceptual design.

**âœ“ DO** use the HR Data Service within a Business Logic Layer .NET application.

 **X DO NOT** use HR Data Service directly within your Presentation Layer projects (i.e. MVC, Web API).
